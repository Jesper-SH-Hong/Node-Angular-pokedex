Happy Thanksgiving!

I've spent whole long weekends to somehow learn and utilize Angular framework just like Hackathon <br>
(to show my passion for Jr. Front-end Developer position at RAZR)

I tried to combine the new angular knowledge with my backend knowledge in Node Express and MongoDB.




## What I've learnt(Still writing)

Connect Angular App - Node - MongoDB

app.module -> component.ts 

Http request -> HttpClientModule ->  this.http.get('/api/.../....')

[Roadblocks]
Async Await - toPromise()
reactiveformsmodule - Can t bind to 'formGroup' since it isn t a known property of 'form


## Future learning
* Fundamental Knowledge about Angular
I wish I could learn more about Angular such as various directives, ...(writing)

## Built With
* [Poke API](https://pokeapi.co/) - The Pokemon API
* Node JS
* Express
* MongoDB
* Angular
