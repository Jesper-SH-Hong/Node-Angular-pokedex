Web Based Single Page Application POKEDEX-APP is built with Angular, Node JS, Express, MongoDB. Pulling live API data from pokeapi.co

<br>

* I tried to learn and implement on Angular over the Thanksgiving weekend.
* Also, I tried to combine those newly acquired skills with my backend knowledge of Node Express and MongoDB.
* It was one of most challenging experience because I tried to avoid using jQuery at all<br>


## What I've learnt

* How to implement web-app without using jQuery
* The structure of Angular component(HTML template(view) / TypeScript Class(behavior) / CSS)
* Understand directives such as *ngFor, ngsubmit
* How to communicate between Angular App - Node(Express) - MongoDB
* How to call http requests in Angular
* How to create template-driven form and bind FormControl
* How to bind data between view template and typescript code
* How to inject my service to the component.(Dependency Injection: pass it as a param of constructor)
* How to add navigation with AppRoutingModule, RouterModule.forRoot(routes) and 'router-outlet'<br>
  (The 'router-outlet' tells the router where to display routed views.)


## Future learning

Since I was given limited time to learn and utilize Angular & Typescript, I couldn't learn everything about Angular this time.
I hope to learn more about Typescript and Angular next time!

  
such as:<br>
* **TypeScript data type**: I declared all the variable as 'any' for this time.<br>
* **Angular Observable & RxJS**: I utilized async/await, promise/then for this app.<br>
* **Angular Reactive forms**: I implemented template-driven form here.<br>
* **Regex**



## Built With
* [Poke API](https://pokeapi.co/) - The Pokemon API
* Node JS
* Express
* MongoDB
* Angular
