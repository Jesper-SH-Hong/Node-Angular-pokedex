Web Based Single Page Application of Pokemon 
NODE-ANGULAR-POKEDEX is built with Angular, Node JS, Express, MongoDB. Pulling live API data from pokeapi.co



## What I've learnt(Still writing)

Connect Angular App - Node - MongoDB

app.module -> component.ts 

Http request -> HttpClientModule ->  this.http.get('/api/.../....')

[Roadblocks]
Async Await - toPromise()
reactiveformsmodule - Can t bind to 'formGroup' since it isn t a known property of 'form

## Built With
* [Poke API](https://pokeapi.co/) - The Pokemon API
* Node JS
