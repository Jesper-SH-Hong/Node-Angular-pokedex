I tried to learn and implement on Angular over the Thanksgiving weekend.

Also, I tried to combine those newly acquired skills with my backend knowledge of Node Express and MongoDB.

It was one of most challenging experience since I tried to avoid using jQuery at all.
Also, I felt that the Angular has a steep learning curve.


## What I've learnt

* How to implement web-app without using jQuery
* The structure of Angular component(HTML template(view) / TypeScript Class(behavior) / CSS)
* Understand directives such as *ngFor, ngsubmit
* How to communicate between Angular App - Node(Express) - MongoDB
* How to call http requests in Angular
* How to create template-driven form and bind FormControl.
* How to bind data between view template and typescript code.
* How to inject my service to the component.(Dependency Injection: pass it as a param of constructor)
* How to add navigation with AppRoutingModule, RouterModule.forRoot(routes) and <router-outlet>
  (The <router-outlet> tells the router where to display routed views.)


## Future learning

Since I was given two days to learn and utilize Angular & Typescript,
I didn't fully cover all the official docs.

I hope to learn more about Typescript and Angular next time.

such as:
TypeScript data type: I declared all the variable as 'any' for this time.
Angular Observable & RxJS: I utilized async/await, promise/then for this app.
Angular Reactive forms: I implemented template-driven form here.



## Built With
* [Poke API](https://pokeapi.co/) - The Pokemon API
* Node JS
* Express
* MongoDB
* Angular
